# koha-worker-sip2-over-http
This tool will (hopefully one day) facilitate a bridge between SIP2 on port 6001 and HTTP/S over port 443/8443. The idea is that, an agent will sit on the self-service unit and translate between the SIP2 and SoH agent/server, wich will sit on the same machine as the SIP2 instance.
